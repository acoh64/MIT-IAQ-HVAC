# MIT-IAQ-HVAC
This repository contains the indoor air quality (IAQ) and heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) time series data used in the paper "Data-driven control of airborne disease transmission and energy use in university buildings" (include citation and link)

## Description
As a part of a MIT-JCI collaboration, a large data set of IAQ-HVAC data was collected in various spaces on the MIT campus. This data was used to test models of airborne disease transmission and analyze building operating modes to balance transmission rates with energy consumption.
